# Color-Hit--ActualGame-
My biggest project so far, a game where you control a character and try to move the colored balls to their colored corner. This will have a currency system, buyable color themes, 
settings, level select, appealing UI and a lot more coding.
Note: I'm a noob in game dev right now, so my code will look very inefficient and messy, but I'm learning on how to improve that as well.
